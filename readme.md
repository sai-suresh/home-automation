# Home Automation using Arduino
Internet of Things or IoT is a recent ongoing revolution in the world of Technology. It involves connecting physical devices to the Internet so that they can perform tasks and be controlled remotely. Most of these devices are connected wirelessly and have greatly reduced human effort. They have led to improved functionality for ordinary appliances and devices which either required repetitive human effort or continuous human control for the device. An extension of IoT is Home Automation, where these IoT devices are used to give smart functionality to certain elements in the home. The proposed system makes use of an Arduino Uno, that forms the basis of the home automation system and can sense the number of occupants in the room with the help of Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors and automatically switch the lights ON/OFF based on occupancy. It uses an ESP8266 module allows Arduino to connect to a Wi-Fi network and make simple TCP/IP connections using Hayes commands. Further, the system also sends data to the ThingSpeak cloud for data analysis.
